% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{pdf/}{jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

With cloud computing technology, specifically infrastructure as a service (IaaS), it is possible to conveniently deploy a virtual machine on the cloud.
There are also a lot of cloud toolkit available to help administrator setup IaaS cloud.
However, to deploy a set of virtual machine and configure them to work together as a virtual cluster is still a complicated and tedious task.
Most cloud toolkit only individual virtual machine management none offer comprehensive virtual cluster management solution.
To address this problem, We propose virtual cluster manager, a unified utility for virtual cluster management.
This paper describe design and implementation of virtual cluster manager built on top of existing cloud toolkit as well as the case study of virtual cluster deployment in traditional way compare to using this utility.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

With cloud computing\cite{Armbrust:EECS-2009-28} being a buzzword recently, there are wide range of cloud computing toolkit available nowadays.
Each provides services in different abstraction.
In this research, We focus on Infrastructure as a Service\cite{ranabahu2009best} (IaaS) paradigm.
These tools offer the ability to manage resources ubiquitously with united cloud interface.

Even though virtual infrastructure (VI) provide virtually limitless computation capability to user.
In reality, performance of each virtual machine (VM) running on the infrastructure is still limited by physical host machine.
It turned out that we have already solved this problem with Cluster Computing.
We could use this same methodology and create a cluster of VM instead of physical machine.
This technology is called Virtual Cluster\cite{1630864} (VC).

However, most VI toolkit (such as OpenNebula\cite{10.1109/MIC.2009.119} and Eucalyptus\cite{nurmi2009eucalyptus}) only focus on individual VM management.
Even though it is possible deploy VC with these existing tools by configure and deploy each VM manually, There is no convenient way to manage VC as a whole yet.
To simplify this process, We propose a utility which manage VC with existing VI toolkit.
This utility will provide to user another layer of abstraction which allow user to view the system as a repository for VC.

In this research, We developed CLI Utility called onevc for OpenNebula 3.0 (VI toolkit) which provide the ability to manage VC as a whole.
This utility work alongside other built-in CLI utilities seamlessly and provide interface similar to existing built-in utilities for consistency.

Following is the organization of this paper.
Section II describes OpenNebula in general and similar utility called ``oneservice'' and differences between ``oneservice'' and this research.
Section III describe the architecture of VC manager.
Section IV describe VC manager implementation based-on OpenNebula VI toolkit.
Section V show a case study of VC deployment with existing tools compare to using VC manager.
Section VI is the conclusion and future improvement ideas.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.

% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

\subsection{OpenNebula}
In this paper and in our VC manager design, We refer to OpenNebula a lot so it is needed to explained briefly about OpenNebula and its architecture.

OpenNebula is VI manager. It orchestrate VM placement, networking and resources such as disk images and expose unified cloud interface to its user, thus create an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
It enable creation of private cloud with existing resources.
OpenNebula also feature its modular architecture which allow it to work with wide range of hypervisor.
This feature also enable OpenNebula to support creation of hybrid cloud as well.

To archive high level of scalability, OpenNebula architecture is designed to be modular.
Using drivers, OpenNebula can be plugged into wide range of datacenter services.
The software stack also divided into multiple layers.
This approach allow us to modify and extend OpenNebula as needed.

OpenNebula is shipped with a number of CLI utilities such as onevm, onevnet, onehost and onetemplate.
Each utility connect to OpenNebula via OpenNebula Cloud API (OCA) and provide abilities to manage many aspect of the cloud.
To deploy a VM with OpenNebula, user need to set up OpenNebula

\subsection{oneservice}
There is a concept of service which consist of multiple VM working together being developed for OpenNebula.
For an example a web server service could consists of web servers, database servers and load-balancers.
oneservice\cite{oneservice} utility allow user to describe service and its dependencies with Service Description Language (SDL).
This idea is similar to the virtual cluster but the key difference is service management allow user to manage as group of virtual machine as a whole while virtual cluster management allow user to manage the whole cluster or just a subset of machines in the cluster.

\section{Architecture}
Similar to how onevm utility of OpenNebula works, to describe a VC to VC manager, We use hierarchical template system.
This template system allow user to describe VC attributes in one single template file.
This template extend existing VM template system by introducing template for VC.
VC manager take VC template as an input and register the VC to database.
After that, user can instruct the manager to do management operations on registered VC or each VM type individually.
Supported management operations are create, deploy, suspend, stop, resume, delete, list and show.

\subsection{Virtual Cluster Model}
In this research, We define VC with a hierarchical model.
A VC consists of one or multiple VM Type, served as a grouping method for VM.
A number of VM could be instantiate in each VM type.
Figure \ref{fig:model} shows hierarchy of VC in this model.

VM types in VC also forming it own hierarchy.
We use this hierarchy along with other configurations to determine deployment order of each VM in a VC.

One example is a VC with one frontend machine and a number of compute node.
To represent this VC with this model, We use 2 VM type to represent frontend VC and compute node VM.
frontend VM type contains only one VM while compute nodes VM type contains n number of VM with compute nodes VM type being a child of frontend VM type.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{model}
\caption{Hierarchical model of virtual cluster}
\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Virtual Cluster Template}
To describe VC with my model, We use template.
For each VC, a VC template is used to describe its properties.
This VC template syntax is the same with OpenNebula template syntax to preserve consistency with others built-in utilities, to be more familiar to user.
VC properties may include information such as name, VC types and number of VM to deploy for each VM type.

To describe each VM type in VC template, we use the same OpenNebula VM template structure.
We also allow pointing to external VM template path or template id of template registered in onetemplate built-in utility.
If VC template is defined with either of this 2 methods, we also allow VM type template overriding from VC template as well.
This allows VM type sharing between many VC template as we could modify VC specific configuration such as networking as needed.

Each VM type is also configurable with external deployment policy such as ``with parent'', ``after parent'' or ``manual'' and internal deployment policy such as ``all together'' or ``one by one''.
These policies will be use to determine deployment order of each VM for automatic cluster deployment.
See figure \ref{fig:template} for an example of Rocks Cluster VC template

To determine deployment order, firstly, we use external deployment policy and VM type hierarchy to determine deployment order of VM type.
VM type that don't have parent will be deploy first.
If there are any child VM type of these VM which external deployment policy set to ``with parent'', those VM type will be deploy at the same time.
After all of these VM type successfully deployed (reached ``running'' state), their childs will be deploy next, and so on until all VM type is deployed.
For deployment order of each machine in the same VM type, we use internal deployment policy.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\caption{Example VC template (detail omitted)}
\label{fig:template}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1in]{hierarchy}
\caption{VM type hierarchy of example VC template}
\label{fig:hierarchy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Virtual Cluster State}
We assign state to each VM type in a VC and the VC itself in order to keep tracking.
During initialization, all VM type will be assigned to ``pending'' state.
State of VM type is shifted along with VC management operations (deploy, suspend, resume, etc.).
State shifting is described in figure \ref{fig:state}.
These states was designed to support OpenNebula's VM state\cite{opennebula-state} and bear a similarity with it.
In a sense, they are like a simplify version or OpenNebula's VM state.

When all VM type in a VC is in the same state, VC itself is assigned with that state as well.
Otherwise, the VC is assigned ``shift'' intermediate state to indicate that the state is being shifted and currently inconsistent.

\section{Implementation}
VC Manager is implemented as OpenNebula CLI utility and named onevc for consistency with other OpenNebula CLI utilities.
onevc is written in Ruby just like other built-in CLI utilities.
It works along with other built-in CLI utilities on the same layer and relied on the same OCA interface.
However, we need to create some more tables in the database to hold VC information.

\subsection{Database}
We uses existing mechanism to manage VM so it use existing \texttt{vm\_pool} table as well.
For VM type, we use existing template system and by storing VM type configuration as template in existing \texttt{template\_pool}.
We define 3 additional tables in the database, \texttt{vc\_pool}, \texttt{vc\_node} and \texttt{vm\_type}.
\texttt{vc\_pool} stores VCs registered to onevc, their configuration from their template and their state.
\texttt{vm\_type} associates each VM type specify in VC template with the actual VM type configuration stored in \texttt{template\_pool}
\texttt{vc\_node} associates each VM with its VC in \texttt{vc\_pool} and VM type in \texttt{template\_pool} as well as recording its state.
Figure \ref{fig:database} show relationship of between each table.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\label{fig:database}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Operation}
User supply VC template to onevc in the same fashion as with onevm utility.
onevc will then validate the template, put it into onevc database and assign all VM type and the VC itself with ``pending'' state.
After that, onevc will create all VC with OpenNebula and put all of them in OpenNebula's ``pending'' state, waiting for deployment.
User could then deploy registered VC and do management tasks with onevc utility.

onevc utility support these operations.

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{create} register VC template to onevc utility and initialize VC
\item \texttt{deploy} deploy specify VC or specify VM type according to VM type hierarchy and deployment policy in VC template
\item \texttt{suspend} suspend VC or specify VM type in reverse order of deployment
\item \texttt{stop} stop VC or specify VM type in reverse order of deployment
\item \texttt{resume} resume VC or specify VM type in the same order as deployment
\item \texttt{delete} delete VC or specify VM type in reverse order of deployment
\item \texttt{list} list registered VCs and their statuses
\item \texttt{show} show specify VC information
\end{itemize}

\section{Case Study}
To show advantages of our manager design, let's take a look at the following cases.
 
\subsection{Ease of use}
We use number of command used to deploy a VC to demonstrate ease of use of the manager.
The less command needed, the more convenient it is.
Using the example VC template in Figure \ref{fig:template}, We deploy the VC with existing utility and onevc utility.

\subsubsection{With existing built-in utility}
Firstly, We created 2 templates for frontend and compute nodes and register it to onetemplate built-in utility with this command.

\texttt{\$ onetemplate create <path\_to\_templatefile>}

Then, We instantiate 1 frontend VM follow by a number of compute node.
To instantiate VM with onetemplate, We used this command.

\texttt{\$ onetemplate instantiate <template\_id>}

Where \texttt{<template\_id>} is one template's template id given to registered template.
It took 2 commands to register template, 1 command to instantiate fronted and 1 command to instantiate each compute node so We used 3+n commands in total.
We also need to maintain each template individually and make sure that configurations in both template worked together.

\subsubsection{With onevc utility}

Let the name of VC configuration file is \texttt{myrockscluster.one}, Firstly, user need to register the template with this command

\texttt{\$ onevc create myrockscluster.one}

After registration, user can use this command.

\texttt{\$ onevc deploy myrockscluster}

According to deployment policies in the template, onevm will deploy frontend VM first.
After it reach ``running'' state, it will deploy n number of compute nodes at once.
User can choose to deploy each VM type manually by using these following commands. 

\texttt{\$ onevc deploy myrockscluster frontend}

\texttt{\$ onevc deploy myrockscluster computenodes}

Note that if fronted VM type isn't at ``running'' state when user manually deploy compute nodes then onevm will try to move frontend to ``running'' state by deploying or resuming as necessary.

In total, We used 2 commands for automatic deployment and 3 commands for manual VM type deployment regardless of how many compute nodes are there in the cluster.

\subsection{Template Reusability}
With VM type hierarchical structure.
It is possible to reuse VM type across multiple VC.
To demonstrate this point, we use number of template needed as a measurement.
In this case, we will deploy 3 virtual Rocks Clusters\cite{CPE:CPE722} with different number of compute node for each VC (l, m and n compute nodes).

\subsubsection{With existing built-in utility}
For each VC, we need 2 VM templates file for frontend node and compute node.
Even if some part of frontend node and compute node share the same configuration, there are differences between each template (such as network configuration to use) so configuration file need to be duplicated and maintained individually.
In total, 6 VM templates are needed.
Each node also need to be deployed manually so OpenNebula can not keep track of number of compute node for each VC at all.
Figure \ref{fig:vmtypeshare} show VC Hierarchy of this configurations.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{vmtypeshare}
\caption{VM type sharing between multiple VC}
\label{fig:vmtypeshare}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{With onevc utility}
Because frontend node and compute node for each VC bare similarity, we define them with single VM type template for each one.
Each VC can just point to these 2 VM type template, specify number of compute node needed and override unique configuration for each VC.
We need 3 VC template and 2 VM type template so there are 6 templates needed in total.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we describe a convenient utility for VC management with existing VI toolkit.
Instead of management each VM in a VC individually, this utility offers a method to manage VC as a whole.
In order to flexibly describe VC, We use hierarchical VC model along with the template system.
This template system also offer policy configurations which to be used alongside VM type hierarchy to determine deployment order.
With this architecture, We implemented onevc utility for OpenNebula and show how to deploy typical VC with this tool compare with existing built-in utility.
It is clear from the result that this utility made VC management simpler.

However, We only look into VC management and leave VC template management totally to user.
For this issue, We could create another utility to manage VC template.
This utility could work in the same manner as onetemplate built-in utility of OpenNebula manage VM template but with VC template instead.
